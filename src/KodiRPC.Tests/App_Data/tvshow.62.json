The arranged marriage of Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, who have two children - 13-year-old Paige and 10-year-old Henry, who know nothing about their parents' true identity - grows more passionate and genuine by the day, but is constantly tested by the escalation of the Cold War and the intimate, dangerous and darkly funny relationships they must maintain with a network of spies and informants under their control.",
